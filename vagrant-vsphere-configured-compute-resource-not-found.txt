Following the documentation at:

https://github.com/nsidc/vagrant-vsphere

http://www.vmtocloud.com/how-to-use-vagrant-to-deploy-containers-on-vsphere-with-vmware-photon/

http://blog.broez.com/vagrant-vsphere-centos-7/

...and so on, does not result in a working configuration.

Critically, what is missing is the need to specify the vsphere.data_center_name as well as the folder that the template is in, 
using both the vsphere.template_name and vsphere.vm_base_path variables.

What follows is a valid Vagrantfile:

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|  
  config.vm.box = "vsphere-dummy"

  config.vm.provider :vsphere do |vsphere|
    # The vSphere host we're going to connect to
    vsphere.host = 'vcenterserver.local'
    vsphere.data_center_name = 'datacentername'

   # The ESX host for the new VM
    vsphere.compute_resource_name = 'esxihost.local'

    # The resource pool for the new VM
    vsphere.resource_pool_name = 'Vagrants'

    # The template we're going to clone
    vsphere.template_name = 'Templates/PhotonVagrant'
    vsphere.vm_base_path = 'Templates'

    # The name of the new machine
    vsphere.name = 'Vagrant.MIPSGCC'

    # vSphere login
    vsphere.user = 'Administrator@vCenter.local'

    # vSphere password
    vsphere.password = 'lolnope'

    # If you don't have SSL configured correctly, set this to 'true'
    vsphere.insecure = true
  end
end
