This is probably obvious, but it is non-obvious to people who have not done it before:

per https://www.nicksherlock.com/2018/11/my-macos-vm-proxmox-setup/ and especially section "hookscript" you need to figure out both the PCI IDs and PCI bus locations of the devices you wish to pass through.

The format of PCI address in `lspci` corresponds to device files in /sys as follows:

04:00.0 == 0000:04:00.0

root@Ymir:/sys/bus/pci/devices# lspci -nn | grep -i ASM
04:00.0 USB controller [0c03]: ASMedia Technology Inc. ASM2142 USB 3.1 Host Controller [1b21:2142]

This can be validated as follows:

root@Ymir:/sys/bus/pci/devices# cd 0000\:04\:00.0
root@Ymir:/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:04:00.0# cat uevent
DRIVER=xhci_hcd
PCI_CLASS=C0330
PCI_ID=1B21:2142
PCI_SUBSYS_ID=1B21:2142
PCI_SLOT_NAME=0000:04:00.0
MODALIAS=pci:v00001B21d00002142sv00001B21sd00002142bc0Csc03i30

Match the PCI_SUBSYS_ID inside the `uevent` file to the PCI subsystem ID presented by `lspci`

ADDITIONALLY:

The 'hookscript' (manually create in /var/lib/vz/snippets/hackintosh.sh) says to unbind the device with
echo 0000:04:00.0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:04\:00.0/driver/unbind

Then attach them to vfio with 
echo 1b21 2142 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/new_id

/sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci is *not* present by default; /sys/bus/pci/drivers/virtio-pci is present by default; both have similar options inside their respective sysbus directories. Don't be misled-- they are not equivalent!

per https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Pci_passthrough,

To enable vfio, first enable IOMMU:
append 'intel_iommu=on' to the kernel command line (in /etc/default/grub)

then enable vfio by dropping the following 4 lines into /etc/modules

vfio
vfio_iommu_type1
vfio_pci
vfio_virqfd

Reboot, run `dmesg | grep -e DMAR -e IOMMU` and check for 'DMAR: IOMMU enabled'; if yes, check /sys/bus/pci/drivers for vfio-pci
